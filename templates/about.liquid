     <h3>Work</h3>
     
     <p>I'm a Senior Instructional Designer in the <a href="http://www.bc.edu/offices/ides.html">Boston College Center for
     Teaching Excellence (CTE)</a> where I
     help support teaching and learning on campus. In this role I regularly
     consult with individuals and groups around campus, facilitate workshops
     on teaching-related technologies, and manage a wide variety of web
     development projects.</p>
     
     <p>I'm also the product manager and lead front-end developer for
     <strong><a href="http://mediakron.bc.edu/">MediaKron</a></strong>, an online toolkit for digital
     curation and storytelling developed at Boston College. MediaKron is
     designed to provide a user-friendly and sustainable way to build digital
     projects in educational settings.</p>
     
     <p>I've been involved with MediaKron since its inception in 2007 but during
     the last year have overseen a re-visioning and redevelopment of the
     application. I work closely with with Brad Mering, the lead developer on
     the project, as well as colleagues in the CTE, the Boston College
     Library, and faculty and students at both Boston College and our partner
     universities.</p>

     <p>I have a B.A. in English from Wheaton College (IL) and a PhD in English
     from Boston College (2009). My <a href="placeblogging.html">dissertation
