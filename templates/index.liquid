           		<p>I worked with Dennis Shirley, professor in the the Lynch School of Education at Boston College, to create The Mindful Teacher website, a resource for teachers and school administrators interested in the emerging intersections between mindfulness and education. Its goal is to provide a curated collection of regularly-updated content presented in an easily accessible format for educators from around the world.
