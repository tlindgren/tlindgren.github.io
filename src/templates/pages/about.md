### Work

I'm a Senior Instructional Designer in the [Boston College Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE)](http://www.bc.edu/offices/ides.html) where I help support teaching and learning on campus. In this role I regularly consult with individuals and groups around campus, facilitate workshops on teaching-related technologies, and manage a wide variety of web development projects.

I'm also the product manager and lead front-end developer for [MediaKron](http://mediakron.bc.edu/) , an online toolkit for digital curation and storytelling developed at Boston College. MediaKron is designed to provide a user-friendly and sustainable way to build digital projects in educational settings.

I've been involved with MediaKron since its inception in 2007 but during the last year have overseen a re-visioning and redevelopment of the application. I work closely with with Brad Mering, the lead developer on the project, as well as colleagues in the CTE, the Boston College Library, and faculty and students at both Boston College and our partner universities.

### Background

I have a B.A. in English from Wheaton College (IL) and a PhD in English from Boston College (2009). My [dissertation research](http://timlindgren.com/placeblogging.html) focused on blogging and how writers use new media to help foster a deeper sense of place. I have presented papers on technology and pedagogy at NERCOMP and NMC Conferences, Mobile Learning in Higher Education (NERCOMP SIG), the International Conference on Teaching and Learning, and the Conference on College Composition and Communication. I've published essays have appeared in Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy (Fall 2005), Coming into Contact: New Essays in Ecocritical Theory and Practice (2006), and Locations of Composition (2006).
